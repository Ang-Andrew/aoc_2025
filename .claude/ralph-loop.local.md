continue with day 3 to day 5. update the each day's readme based on your findings. don't take any shortcuts. make sure you think you ultrathink this to make sure that we trade off between latency and resources. We want 250MHz to be running for this algo and all tests cocotb and verilog sim to pass with the design we implemented to 250MHz.  Rememeber you are a principal fpga engineer, make no mistakes. You are finished when timing is met for 250Mhz and their respective cocotb tests and verilog sim pass for each days. you have to try at least 3 different architectures that you haven't explored yet for each days. you can stop if you tried these 3 architectures and none of them meet timing. Report this when it happens and why.  You are allowed to use dsps or other hard ips on the ecp5 fpga now
