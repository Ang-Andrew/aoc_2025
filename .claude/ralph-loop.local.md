continue with day 3. update the readme for day3 based on your findings. don't take any shortcuts. make sure you think you ultrathink this to make sure that we trade off between latency and resources. End of the day we want 250MHz to be running for this algo. Rememeber you are a principal fpga engineer, make no mistakes. You are finished when timing is met for 250Mhz for day3 or you tried 5 different architectures you haven't explored yet and none of them meets the 250MHz. You are allowed to use dsps or other hard ips on the ecp5 fpga now
